            <p>Kürtőskalács (Read kurtosh kalach) is a spit cake specific to Hungary and Hungarian-Speaking regions in
              Romania, more predominantly the Székely Land. Earlier a festive treat, now it is part of everyday
              consumption.</p>
            <p>Kürtőskalács is made from sweet, yeast dough, of which a strip is spun and then wrapped around a
              truncated cone–shaped baking spit, and rolled in granulated sugar. It is roasted over charcoal while
              basted with melted butter, until its surface cooks to a golden-brown color. During the baking process the
              sugar caramelizes and forms a shiny, crispy crust. The surface of the cake can then be topped with
              additional ingredients such as ground walnut or powdered cinnamon.</p>

            <!-- <p>The first known recipe of Kürtőskalács originates from Transylvania, included in the 1784 cookbook of Countess Mária Mikes of Zabola. It makes no mention, however, of sweetening of any kind in the preparation. A recipe from the cookbook written by Kristóf Simai in 1795 in Upper Hungary (present-day Slovakia) first mentioned “sweetening subsequent to baking”. Trdelnik from Szakolca (Skalica) is based on similar preparation, with the cake surface covered in chopped nuts (e.g. walnut, almond) before baking, and sugar that is added only subsequent to baking.</p>
            <p>Almost 100 years passed before the first mention was made of the next step in the evolution of kürtőskalács, the appearance of a caramelized sugar glaze, in Aunt Rézi’s Cookbook written by Terézia Dolecskó in 1876, published in Szeged, Hungary. The recipe suggests “sprinkling sugar (sugar almond) on dough on spit a priory to baking”. Due to the heat, the sugar is caramelized and also enters in what is known as Maillard reaction. The sugar glaze that melts to become caramel forms a continuous coat, also adds to firmness of cake. Shortly afterwards, pure sugar (not almond sugar) was applied to the dough’s surface before baking, even with the omission of sweetening subsequent to baking. Ágnes Zilahi’s cookbook entitled The Real Hungarian Cookbook, which appeared in Budapest in 1892, presents such a recipe.</p> -->

            <p>Except the Kürtőskalács, there are other kinds of spit cakes all around europe, some resemble the

            <p>Trdelník is a kind of spit cake. It is made from rolled dough that is wrapped around a stick, then
              grilled and topped with sugar and walnut mix.</p>
            <p>Spettekaka or spettkaka (spiddekaga in native Scanian) is a local dessert of the southern parts of
              Sweden, chiefly in the province of Scania (Skåne) but also in Halland. It is an important part of the
              Scanian culinary heritage. The name means “cake on a spit”, and this describes the method of preparation:
              it is the Swedish variation on the spit cake.</p>

            <p>Baumkuchen is a traditional pastry of many European countries throughout, and also a popular snack and dessert in Japan. The characteristic rings, which resemble tree rings when sliced, give the cake its German name, Baumkuchen, which literally translates to “tree cake”.</p> -->

              <h4>Ingredients</h4>
              <p>7/8 cup unsalted butter, softened<br>
                1 cup sifted confectioners’ sugar<br>
                7/8 cup cornstarch<br>
                5 1/2 ounces almond paste<br>
                1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
                1 pinch salt<br>
                2 egg yolks<br>
                6 egg whites<br>
                3/4 cup white sugar<br>
                3/4 cup all-purpose flour<br>
                9 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate<br>
                2 1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-8">
              <h4>Directions</h4>
              <p>Butter a 9 inch square metal pan. Place a sheet of parchment paper in the bottom. Butter the parchment,
                and flour the whole pan. Position the rack of the oven to the lowest level, and preheat the broiler.<br>
                In a large bowl, cream the butter or margarine until light and fluffy. Add in the almond paste in small
                chunks; beat until smooth. Add the confectioners’ sugar, cornstarch, vanilla, and salt. Beat in the
                yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat until smooth.<br>
                In another bowl, beat the egg whites to soft peaks. Add in the sugar slowly while continuing to beat the
                meringue to stiff, glossy peaks. Fold the meringue into the yolk mixture. Sift the flour over this, and
                fold in.<br>
                Spoon a small amount of batter onto the parchment in the baking pan. With a pastry brush, paint the
                batter on. You want to cover the paper completely, but have a thin layer. Place under the broiler, and
                cook until light brown; this should take about 1 to 2 minutes. Brush another layer of the batter over
                the cake, and place under the broiler. Continue on in this way until all of the batter is used. Cool
                completely. Turn the cake out of the pan, and trim the edges clean.<br>
                In a double boiler, combine the chocolate and the oil. Heat until the chocolate is smooth. With a pastry
                brush, brush one side of the trimmed cake with some chocolate. Don’t make it too thick. Allow this to
                harden. Turn the cake over, and brush the other side. Allow the cake to set. Cut the cake into 6 narrow
                strips, each about 1-1/2 inches wide. Brush the sides and top with the glaze, and allow to set. Store in
                the refrigerator, but serve at room temperature.</p>
